# FFT Implementation and Benchmarking

This directory contains an implementation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm along with benchmarking tools to compare the precision of standard floating-point and HUB-format floating-point calculations.

## Overview

The FFT implementation in this directory provides a templated approach that works with different numeric types, including:
- Standard `float`
- Standard `double`
- Custom `hub_float` type

The code is designed to compare numerical accuracy between these types, with `double` precision used as the reference implementation.

## Files

- `fft.hpp`: Header file with templated function declarations for the FFT algorithm
- `fft.cpp`: Implementation of the FFT algorithm
- `main.cpp`: Benchmark program that compares precision between `float` and `hub_float` types

## FFT Algorithm

The implementation uses the Cooley-Tukey radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT algorithm, which:
1. Rearranges input data using bit-reversal permutation
2. Performs the butterfly operations for computation

The algorithm works in-place, meaning the input arrays are overwritten with the FFT results.

## Benchmark

The benchmark program:
- Tests FFT on various sizes (powers of 2): 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096
- Runs multiple trials (default: 1000) for statistical significance
- Compares `hub_float` against standard `float` using `double` as reference
- Analyzes both real and imaginary parts separately
- Calculates error statistics (average, maximum, minimum, relative errors, and SNR)

## Usage

### Running the Benchmark

Compile and run the main program:

```bash
g++ -o fft_benchmark main.cpp fft.cpp -I../../src -std=c++11
./fft_benchmark
```

### Output

The program produces:
1. Console output with summarized results
2. A CSV file containing detailed results for each trial
3. Optional Mathematica-compatible data files for deeper analysis

### CSV File Format

The generated CSV includes:
- FFT Size
- Type (`float` or `hub_float`)
- Component (real or imaginary)
- Trial number
- Average error
- Maximum error
- Minimum error
- Relative error
- Variance
- SNR (dB)

## Using the FFT Functions

```cpp
#include "fft.hpp"

// Example with float data
unsigned int N = 1024; // Must be a power of 2
std::vector<float> real_part(N), imag_part(N);

// Fill with your data...

// Perform FFT in-place
fft(real_part.data(), imag_part.data(), N);

// real_part and imag_part now contain the FFT result
```

## Notes

- The implementation requires the input length to be a power of 2
- Results are not normalized (divide by âˆšN if normalization is needed)
- For the hub_float implementation, ensure the HUBsim library is properly linked
